intro_text <- "Currently the Executive Director at the Good Data Institute, Founding member and Data Scientist at Multitudes and a PhD candidate at the University of Melbourne School of Mathematics and Statistics. My PhD research is conducting Instance Space analysis on Quantum optimisation algorithms, under the supervision of Prof. Kate Smith-Miles and Dr Charles Hill

I am someone who loves math, coding and travel. I pride myself on making my work reproducible and thrive for best practice. I enjoy getting my hands dirty in data and am always looking for opportunities where technology can be used for social good."
